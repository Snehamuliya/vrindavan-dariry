    <div class="col-sm-6"><h2>1. Desi Gir Cows Farm</h2><br><p style="font-family:Sitka Text;"><br> We have selected best Gir cows from all over Western india to create an elite herd.
Our cows follow their natural feeding behaviour by grazing in forest & pastures full of medicinal grasses. They rest in afternoon under tree shades in forest.
Their calves drink their stomach full of happy milk up to age of 8 months till they start eating grasses. We don’t use artificial insemination for breeding of
 our cows, as we believe it is against their natural instincts. We always have a superior pedigree bull to improve the pedigree of herd.

the milk they produce is sweet, creamy and loaded with nutrition.
We say no to chemicals at our farm. To keep our cows and our consumers healthy.
Everything at Kesariya farm is traceable. Right from Our gir cow’s breed to the feed they eat everyday.
Every single day, Our Gir cows go for grazing in forest pastures full of medicinal grasses, herbs and plants. They follow their life as nature intended with complete freedom of life.

    <div class="col-sm-6"><h2>3. No Weaning</h2><br><p style="font-family:Sitka Text;"><br> The calves at our farm drink milk directly from their mother,
	unlike most milk producers who separate the calves from the cows at birth and feed them separately so as to get more milk from cows.
Over last 8 years, our cows have taught us to learn from nature, because nature makes no mistakes.
We belive, Organic food is best instrument to ensure healthy lifestyle, to live in harmony with our bio- rhythms, our society, our world.

    <div class="col-sm-6"><h2>4. Organic Farming</h2><br><p style="font-family:Sitka Text;">Great dairy starts with great pasture ! <br>We use sustainable natural methods
	of farming unlike Non-organic farms which use toxic pesticides and herbicides, fertilizers to manage the farm production.
These chemicals are really harmful to wildlife, soil and human health, contaminating our food, air, and water, and accumulating in our cells.
At our farm, we forbid use of these chemicals—making cows, honey bees, ants, earthworms and all other living beings happier, and our food more nutritious.

    <div class="col-sm-6"><h2>5. Free from Synthetic Hormones</h2><br><p style="font-family:Sitka Text;">Because our Cows and Kids should grow at their own pace.
In modern dairies, Synthetic hormones and antibiotics are frequently given to cows to get more milk and speed up their growth.
We believe that cows are happiest and healthiest when they live as per their natural life patterns without any chemical intervention.
the milk from these cows is most nutritious and free from any traces of harmful chemicals.
At our farm, we forbid use of these chemicals—making cows, honey bees, ants, earthworms and all other living beings happier, and our food more nutritious.

    <div class="col-sm-6"><h2>6. Direct from Farm to Your Home</h2><br><p style="font-family:Sitka Text;">Our farm fresh Raw Milk is produced by happy gir cows living their life in most natural way on our own farm. The quality of milk is therefore guaranteed.
While other milk producers sell packaged milk collected from shepherds and farmers, thus they can never ensure right quality of milk.
Milk with more Omega-3s.
The happier cows are, the more healthy the milk and naturally more Omega-3s – means best nutrition for your family.
