We were a handful of software engineers and we were fed up with the state of milk in India. Adulteration had become rampant and transparency was going extinct. At Vrindavan Farms, our humble mission is to serve cows with love and devotion. In the process, we engage in protecting cows, promoting the growth of desi cows and their products, and helping farmers to get back to organic farming with the help of cows. This enables us to serve our customers with traditional dairy and food products leading us to a happier and healthier lifestyle.
